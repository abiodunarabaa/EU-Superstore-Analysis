Welcome to my Tableau visualization project, where I present insights derived from the Sample - EU Superstore dataset. In this project, I analyze sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends to provide actionable insights for optimizing business operations and enhancing customer satisfaction in EU Superstore.


## Key Objectives:
Sales Analysis: Analyze sales trends, revenue distribution, and performance metrics across different product categories, regions, and time periods.
Customer Segmentation: Segment customers based on purchasing behavior, demographics, and order characteristics to identify high-value customers and target marketing efforts.

## Methodology:
Data Preparation: Preprocessed and cleaned the Sample - EU Superstore dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
Data Exploration: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Tableau to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations in the data, leveraging interactive visualizations and dashboards.
Customer Segmentation: Utilized clustering algorithms or RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and characteristics.
Product Analysis: Evaluated product performance metrics such as sales volume, revenue contribution, and profit margins to identify top-performing products and underperforming items.
Geospatial Analysis: Visualized sales data on maps using Tableau's mapping capabilities to identify regional sales patterns and opportunities for market expansion.
Dashboard Creation: Developed interactive dashboards and reports in Tableau to present key findings and insights in a visually appealing and user-friendly format.
